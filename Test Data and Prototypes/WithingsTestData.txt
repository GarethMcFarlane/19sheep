Sleep Measure Data:

Each "{ }" in the series part indicates a transition from one sleep level to another.  So the below data means the user had three sleep levels.
I don't think this example is complete.  You can add more values to it if you want to get more detailed.

"startdate" = date in the form of number of seconds from Jan 1st 1970
"enddate" = date in the form number of seconds from Jan 1st 1970
(We can convert these to dates later on.  For now you can use this: http://www.epochconverter.com/)

"model": 16 is activity tracker, 32 is the Withings Aura
"state": 
0 = Awake
1 = Light sleep
2 = Deep Sleep
3 = REM Sleep (only if model is 32)

For example, the below data show the user was in bed at 8pm on 03/12/2014, then went into light sleep at 8:16pm then went into REM sleep at 8:33 PM.

 Sleep Summary Data:


"startdate" and "enddate": same as above
"model": same as above
"date": the date the sleep data ends.
duration values are in seconds
"durationtosleep" is time taken to fall asleep
"duratetowakeup" is time taken to wake up

Below user lives in Paris and went to bed at 9:34pm on the 12/09/2014 and woke up at 3:22am.  They had
30 minutes of being awake, 5.15 hours of light sleep, 2.35 hours of deep sleep, 2.9 hours of REM sleep, took 7 minutes to fall asleep
and took 6 minutes to wake up.  They woke up 3 times.  From what I can tell light is recorded even when the user is in deep sleep.
